# machine_learning_project-unsupervised-learning

## Project Outcomes
- Unsupervised Learning: perform unsupervised learning techniques on a wholesale data dataset. The project involves four main parts:    

        1. Exploratory data analysis
        2. Pre-processing
        3. KMeans clustering
        4. Hierarchical clustering, and PCA.

### Duration:
Approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes

### Project Description:
In this project, we applied unsupervised learning techniques to a real-world data set and use data visualization tools to communicate the insights gained from the analysis.

The data set for this project is the "Wholesale Data" dataset containing information about various products sold by a grocery store.
The project will involve the following tasks:

-	Exploratory data analysis and pre-processing: 
        1. We imported and cleaned the data sets
        2. Analyzed and visualized the relationships between the different variables 
        3. Handled missing values and outliers
        4. Performd feature engineering as needed.

-	Unsupervised learning: We used the Wholesale Data dataset to perform k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to identify patterns and group similar data points together. We determined the optimal number of clusters and communicated the insights gained through data visualization.

From exploratory data analysis (EDA)**:
        
        1.Channel wise, the majority of the wholesaler's clients belong to the Channel 1 as comapred to Chaneel 2. Around 68% of the customers of this wholesaler are from Channel 1, whereas only 32% are Channel 2.

        2. Region wise, the biggest chunk of clients of the wholesaler are aggregated into 'Region 3'.  72% the customer base of this wholesaler are densely located there. 

        3. We should re-categorizing client region. This will positively allow better insights into the regions and channels mapping, instead of having a big chunk of density amalgamation in 'One Region'.

        4.Product Category wise, there are 5 product categories 'Fresh, Milk, Grocery, Frozen, Detergents_Paper, Delicassen'. The distributions of those categories reveals that the annual spending of those the majority of customers in our dataset have low to moderate spending. There are also a few outliers in such columns which represents a few clients who spend a lot. 

        5. From visualizations, we can see most spending on is on Fresh & Least on Delicassen
